# SDL-Game-Engine
Just a simple game engine written using SDL2, comes included with a runnable demo!

## How to build
I wrote this on my Macbook so at the moment I only included a very primitive build script to use on MacOSX. Though it should be possible to build and run without any modifications to the code on Windows or Linux as well. Keep in mind you need to have  the SDL2 development library installed on your system.
